# Introduction
This workshop will show you how to proceed when to detect Copy Number Variants (CNV) using either Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or SNParray data 

The initial structure of your folders should look like this:
```
UKworkshop/
|-- src/                     # scripts
|-- NGS_CNV/                 # Analysis folder for NGS data
|-- SNP_CNV/                 # Analysis folder for SNParray data
|-- SNParray/                # BAF and logR files per sample
|-- alignment/               # bam files generated previously
    `-- normal               # Normal sample directory
    `-- tumor                # Tumor sample directory

```

---------------------------
# Data
in this hands-on two types of data are available: SNParray and NGS data

**NGS data**

approximately 1M of Illumina paired-end 100 reads covering the region _chr19 : 50500375 - 52501256_ from a whole genome experiment for germline and matched tumor samples.

For each sample:

	1 alignment file (.bam generated in the previous hands-on) on the human reference sequence

**SNParray data**

Illumina data for more than 650000 SNPs located genome wide for germline and matched tumor samples

For each sample:

	1 file containing the LogRatio (LRR) mesurement of each probe: the signal intensities compared to a collection of reference hybridizations
	1 file containing the B Allele Frequency (BAF) mesurement of each probe: the proportion of the total allele signal (A + B) explained by a single allele (A) 



**What are the advantages and limitations of using each type of technology ?**

# NGS data analysis

We will start from two alignment files of the tumor and germline samples form the same individual and we will apply a manual read depth procedure to estimate the tumoral copy number.

# SNParray data analysis

SNParray analysis are very similar to NGS data analysis while incorporating the additional information bring by the SNP: the BAF. In this analysis we will start from one LRR signal file and one BAF signal file for each of the germline and matched tumor samples from an individul.

Many software are avaiable for doing CNV call from SNParray. Here is a non-exhaustive list of  softaware that could be used:
